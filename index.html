Comments regarding course waiver

For the 539 waiver you will be required to provide a link to a self-coded website. Sites should be a minimum of three pages. Note that frameworks (Bootstrap, React, etc) are ok, but not templates (Google Site, Wix, etc.) You need to have written the HTML and a large portion of the CSS yourself.

You will be required to validate your code validator.w3.org, Wave (http://wave.webaim.org/), and Axe (https://www.deque.com/axe/). If there are any errors (warnings are ignored) you are expected to justify them and describe steps taken to fix them.

You will be required to provide a link to a zipped archive with all of the following: your code, screenshots of each page being checked by WebAim, screenshots of each page being checked by Axe and explanations of any accessibility errors.
